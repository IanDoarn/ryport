Ryport

Ryport is a python module that utilizes psycopg2, XML files, 
and xlsxwriter to create excel files from postgres query results.
Using XML, report structures can be saved and re run. In the future you
will be able to re run them automatically and refresh give excel files. 
Ryport can load sql files and run them, convert the results to an excel file
placing them in a table. Ryport can also filter results and convert the data
do what ever type you would like.
